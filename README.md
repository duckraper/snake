## Description

This small and minimalist project is from a few years ago, when I was learning Python. I decided that the most fun way to learn programming was by making games, or at least replicating some of the classics. Among them, the first one I managed to complete in my own way was this one, and besides the messy code and a lot of missing possible optimizations, i'm really proud of it <3.

### How to run

- Clone the repo
- Create a virtual environment (optional)
- Install the dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
- `cd` into the `src` directory
- Run the game
```bash
python3 main.py
```
